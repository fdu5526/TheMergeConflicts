# The Merge Conflicts


The parallel worlds are in disarray!

A long time ago, the worlds were as one in the master world. Then, unknown forces caused them to break and branch into multiple worlds, running in parallel.

Now, eons later, the unknown force is merging them back into one. However, because of the long amount of time separating them, the worlds cannot merge peacefully. Merge conflicts occur and threaten the destruction of the many worlds!

The impact of the conflicts are so strong, they resonate into our world too. However, without knowing the culture of these worlds, we cannot hope to identify them in our everyday life.

We need to fix these conflicts, and in order to do so, we need to learn about each of these worlds, and peacefully fix their conflicts with each other to allow the merge to happen successfully. However, we are currently short on staff. We do not have the manpower to dive into each world, learn about them through the dive, find fractures of their impacts in our world, and successfully merge them with each other. We need your help!


To gain the right to dive into worlds, open up your computer terminal, and type
	
	git clone git@github.com:fdu5526/TheMergeConflicts.git

	git pull origin master

To dive into a world (a branch in Git), type
	
	git checkout <The name of a world>
