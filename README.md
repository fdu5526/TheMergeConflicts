# The Merge Conflicts


The parallel worlds are in disarray!

A long time ago, the worlds were as one in the master world. Then, unknown forces caused them to break and branch into multiple worlds, running in parallel.

Eons later, the unknown force is merging them back into one. However, because of the long amount of time separating them, the worlds cannot merge peacefully. Merge conflicts occur and threaten the destruction of the many worlds!
